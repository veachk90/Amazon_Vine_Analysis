# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

#### Overview
The purpose of the Amazon Vine program was to allow manufacturers and publishers to pay a subscription fee. By doing so, the customers would be eligible to purchase their products, though they would also be required to publish a review. The purpose of this analysis, then, was to determine whether the paid reviews would contain any bias in their raitings.

#### Results
Initial results indicate that there is likely not any bias either in favor of, nor against, paid reviews from the Vine program. The percentage of Vine reviews for 5-star ratings was 46.9925%, whereas that of the unpaid reviews was 46.9907%. By inspection, then, these percentages do not indicate significant bias in the reviews. If there were greater differences between them, futher statistical analysis could be warranted. In such a case, t-test comparisons could be made between the observed percentages and the expected values of the respective populations. Based on the available data, however, doing so would not be likely to yield any unsurprising results.
